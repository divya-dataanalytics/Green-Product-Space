This folder contains code and visualizations created for green product space analysis of Texas and Florida states in USA.

About Project:
A Green Economy promotes the transition to low-carbon, resource-efficient, and socially inclusive
economies, which in todayâ€™s world is of foremost importance. It is very important for all world
economies to lower their carbon footprint while moving towards an economically stable and
flourishing future. It is based on the concept that if economic expansion is the primary goal,
economic growth must be decoupled from resource use and negative environmental consequences.
The increase in the population and their growing needs has led to climate change and
environmental risk that is encouraging policymakers to take steps towards green development.
Through the insights and inferences drawn from this project, we can enable the economies (of
Texas and Florida) to develop strategies that can ensure the development of green production that
brings a sustainable future. This was one of the key factors that motivated us to analyze this data.
For this project, we have analyzed the data from the USA Trade online website that is provided by
the U.S. Census Bureau. The data includes export values of each green product for all the states of
the United States (US) that are exported over a period of 5 years (2016 to 2020). The export value
of each green product for each year is based on US dollars, and the dataset contains a 6-digit
Harmonized System (HS) code for each green product along with its name. Additionally, a list of
green products that is constructed using a combined list of environmental goods developed by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCED) is used to identify green
products from the comprehensive list of all products (commodities).
